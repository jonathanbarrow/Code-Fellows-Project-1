Service Level Agreement
Powershellarz Consulting
8/17/2020
Version 1.1


SLA Purpose and Introduction

	The purpose of the SLA is to outline certain benefits, scope, and duration that the contracted Managed Service Provider will perform benefits for Keepe. The SLA will also perform as an outline to any updates to the agreement between the two above mentioned parties. The SLA will cover a term of 3 months wherein Powershellarz will provide a MSP statement of work and a cloud vs on-prem proof of concept for networking purposes. The proof of concept will only cover Keepes current network upgrades as well as certain ‘virtualization’ friendly applications relevant for cloud deployment. 

SLA KPIs and Metrics

	The key performance indicators that will be referenced for the proof of concept will be the total cost of the service provided as well as the estimated cost of adopting either a on-prem or cloud based network.

SLA Rankings and Priority

	Since Powershellarz was hired explicitly to provide a proof of concept that will remain the priority throughout the term of the SLA. Any additional scripts used for automation will be included in the final MSP statement of work and/or final presentation. 

SLA Responses and Responsibilities  

	If at any time during the course of the SLA the client wants to update any part of the scope of work or duration, they are required to notify the project leader for approval. Once this has been accomplished the version of the SLA will be updated to reflect any agreed upon changes.
