Our GNS3 proof of concept idea will be a working ‘dummy’ network of Keepe’s proposed network expansion. This proof of concept will serve as a costing and logistical benchmark in order to make future on-prem or cloud purchasing decisions. 

The problem we have identified is that Keepe needs to upgrade their current network but are not sure on which model to use, on-prem or cloud based. 

Our MVP will be a tailored network diagram that can display the hardware costs, infrastructure needs, and logistics of the proposed network using real virtualizations of network infrastructure.
