Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Compose thorough SOPs for each of the following:
How will you backup and restore user data, critical infrastructure configurations and hosted data?
We will create an automated bash and/or powershell script that will enable Keepe’s directories and files to be routinely updated. Although this will provide a holistic method to data backup and prevent data loss the more Keepe adds files/directories the more the script would need to be updated in order to represent the new root paths. 
How will you securely dispose of sensitive data from storage media?
Sensitive data will need to be removed completely from any type of storage media before reuse. This includes wiping it from the storage device as well as from the host OS if the data is no longer needed. This will need to follow each workstation's individual internal storage optimizations based on data use. 
How will you perform the support engagements/interactions?
Since Keepe does not have an assigned help desk technician for IT support challenges we advise it to create a series of technicians that can perform routine network maintenance.
