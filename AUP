Objective
[Keepe] recognizes that use of the Internet and e-mail is necessary in the workplace, and employees are encouraged to use the Internet and e-mail systems responsibly, as unacceptable use can place [Keepe] and others at risk. This policy outlines the guidelines for acceptable use of [Keepe]'s technology systems.
Scope
This policy must be followed in conjunction with other [Keepe] policies governing appropriate workplace conduct and behavior. Any employee who abuses the company-provided access to e-mail, the Internet, or other electronic communications or networks, including social media, may be denied future access and, if appropriate, be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
Policy
[Keepe] has established the following guidelines for employee use of the company's technology and communications networks, including the Internet and e-mail, in an appropriate, ethical and professional manner.
 
Confidentiality and Monitoring
All technology provided by [Keepe], including computer systems, communication networks, company-related work records and other information stored electronically, is the property of [Keepe] and not the employee. In general, use of the company's technology systems and electronic communications should be job-related and not for personal convenience. 
Appropriate Use
[Keepe] employees are expected to use technology responsibly and productively as necessary for their jobs. Internet access and e-mail use is for job-related activities; however, minimal personal use is acceptable.
Employees may not use [Keepes]'s Internet, e-mail or other electronic communications to transmit, retrieve or store any communications or other content of a defamatory, discriminatory, harassing or pornographic nature. No messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual's race, age, disability, religion, national origin, physical attributes or sexual preference may be transmitted. Harassment of any kind is prohibited.
Disparaging, abusive, profane or offensive language and any illegal activities—including piracy, cracking, extortion, blackmail, copyright infringement and unauthorized access to any computers on the Internet or e-mail—are forbidden.
Copyrighted materials belonging to entities other than [Keepe] may not be transmitted by employees on the company's network without permission of the copyright holder.
Employees are prohibited from downloading software or other program files or online services from the Internet without prior approval from the IT department. All files or software should be passed through virus-protection programs prior to use. Failure to detect viruses could result in corruption or damage to files or unauthorized entry into company systems and networks.
Every employee of [Keepe] is responsible for the content of all text, audio, video or image files that he or she places or sends over the company's Internet and e-mail systems. No e-mail or other electronic communications may be sent that hide the identity of the sender or represent the sender as someone else. [Keepe]'s identity is attached to all outgoing e-mail communications, which should reflect corporate values and appropriate workplace language and conduct. 
I have read and fully understand this policy. I understand that my use of [Keepe]'s information and communication technology constitutes full acceptance of the terms of this policy and consent to monitoring.
